# Obsidian Vim Yank Highlighter

## Known limitations

The highlight timeout only works if the cursor is moved after it, otherwise it stays highlighted.

## Installation

There is no release, which means that the plugin needs to be built locally.

## Contribute

Please use the [`.eslintrc` configuration located in the repository](.eslintrc) and run eslint before doing a pull request, and please do *not* use `prettier`. ðŸ™‚

```shell
# Run eslint fixing most common mistakes
eslint --fix *.ts
```

## Credits

This plugin uses monkey-around code from @pjeby, which is ISC-licensed.

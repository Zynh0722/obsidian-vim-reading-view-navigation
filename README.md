# Obsidian Vim Yank Highlighter

## Known limitations

The highlight timeout only works if the cursor is moved after it, otherwise it stays highlighted.

## Installation
Right now, the plugin is still in beta. It can be installed with the [BRAT Plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

## Contribute

## Credits

# Obsidian Vim Reading View Navigation

This plugin allows to scroll with <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> in the Reading View.

It also lets you navigate with <kbd>gg</kbd> and <kbd>G</kbd> to the top or bottom of a note. (When embeds are present, you may need to press <kbd>G</kbd> more than once.)

## Bugs

The search in Editing and Reading view cannot be closed with <kbd>Esc</kbd>. This also applies to the other shortcuts associated with search. 

## Configuration

The scroll speed can be configured in the settings.

## Installation

It can be installed manually or via BRAT. It is not in the community plugins.
